## â­• Car Detection â­•
### Car detection based on Haar-like classifiers, which is the most common technique in computer-vision for cars.
The objective of the program given is to detect object of interest(Car) in video frames and to keep tracking the same object.
### Why Vehicle Detection?
1) The startling losses both in human lives and finance caused by vehicle accidents.
2) Detecting vehicles in images acquired from a moving platform is a challenging problem.
